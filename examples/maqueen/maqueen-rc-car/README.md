# Maqueen RC Car
_Requires two Microbits and a Maqueen robot._

## Overview

## Usage
### Installation and setup
- Load the program in the [Python editor](https://python.microbit.org/v/3/project), e.g. by importing the hex file.
- Flash it onto **two** Microbits.
- Disable the motors on the Maqueen robot (toggle switch on the side) and turn it on. 
- Connect one Microbit to the Maqueen robot - this Microbit is now the _car controller_.
- Use the `A` button on the car controller to set it into `car controller` mode, indicated by a `C` on the screen.
- Connect the other Microbit to a battery pack (or leave it plugged into a USB port). This Microbit is now the _remote control_.
- Use the `A` button to set the remote control into `remote control: parking` mode, indicated by a `P` on the screen.
  - **Caution:** If the screen is showing a `D` instead of a `P`, press the `B` button once to switch from `driving` into `parking` mode.
- Enable the motors on the Maqueen robot (toggle switch on the side).

### Driving
After completing the installation and setup steps, the Maqueen RC car is now ready for driving.
- Hold the remote control upright, in landscape orientation, with the Microbit logo facing toward you. Tilt slightly toward yourself.
- Press the `B` button on the remote to switch from `parking` to `driving` mode, indicated by a `D` on the screen.
- Start tilting the remote control away from yourself to let the Maqueen drive forward. Tilt sideways to steer.
